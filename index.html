                <p>My dearest Siddhi,</p>
                
                <p>As you turn the page to a new chapter of your life, I wanted to write you a little note to celebrate the wonderful person you are.</p>
                
                <p>I still remember the day we met at the college canteen during induction week. Since then, you've been one of the best parts of my journey. Your kindness, intelligence, and vibrant spirit have made my college experience truly special.</p>
                
                <p>Even though you're from ENCS, it's never felt like we're from different branches — you've always been someone I could connect with effortlessly. Our conversations, whether about studies or life, always leave me feeling inspired.</p>
                
                <p>As you celebrate this special day, I wish you a year filled with new adventures, beautiful moments, and stories worth telling. May your path be lined with joy, success, and all the happiness you deserve.</p>
                
                <p>Here's to writing another amazing chapter in the beautiful story of your life!</p>
